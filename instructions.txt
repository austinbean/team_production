how it works...


There is a nice chapter by Jesus Fernandez Villaverde about Git here: 
https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Chapter_HPC_5_Git.pdf
It is probably more detail than you need...

Steps:

- sign up at github.com
- send me your username
- my account is github.com/austinbean
- the repository is github.com/austinbean/team_production
-
